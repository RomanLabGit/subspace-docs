# Translation Guide

This guide will show you how to provide translations for this documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Crowdin Account: They are free, and will be a necessity if you would like to contribute to our translations, you can create an account [here](https://accounts.crowdin.com/register)
- Join the Autonomys Network project on Crowdin.
    - [Documentation Project Portal](https://crowdin.com/project/subspace-docs)
    - [Website Project Portal](https://crowdin.com/project/subspace-website)


## Guidelines

- Our goal with providing translations on our docs is to crowd source a great multi-language environment. Due to this, if you see what you would like to translate has already been added, please do not add a second translation. Rather it would be more beneficial to peer review the existing translation, and provide any feedback, edits, or improvements.

- Ensure you follow our [Contributing](contribute) Standards, and our [Code of Conduct](/participate/contribute/code-of-conduct).
