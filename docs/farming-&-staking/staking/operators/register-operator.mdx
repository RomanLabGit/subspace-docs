:::note
Currently, the domain chain does not support syncing from other operator nodes; it needs to be deterministically derived from the consensus chain block by block.
:::

### Check the list of the available domains:
In order to participate in block production, operator needs to register on a specific domain. 

:::note
Any account with the **minimum operator stake** can become an operator. 
:::

To check the list of available domains: 
1. Proceed to [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
2. Make sure to select the correct network at the top-left corner.
3. Go to Developer -> Chain state
![Staking-1](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-1.png)
4. Select `domains` under `selected state query` and choose `domainRegistry`
5. Exclude `option`
6. Click on `+` to query the chain state.
![Staking-2](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-2.png)
7. Review the list of available domains
![Staking-3](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-3.png)
:::tip
In the example above the number 3 corresponds to the domainId. 
The example is not Stake Wars specific, the operator is responsible for finding out the correct domain ID they want to operate on. **Stake Wars are using the domains with IDs 0 (Nova) and 1 (AutoID)**.
:::

### Create operator key

An operator needs a key pair to participate in bundle production.

To create a new operator key, run the following command:
`subspace-node domain key create --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --domain-id 0`

Make sure to specify the base **--base-path** for the key generation, and running an operator node and make sure to replace **--domain-id value** with the domain ID you would like to be an operator on.

**You have successfully generated an operator key, congratulations!**

:::note
Be sure to record and securely store the printed seed phrase. If it is leaked or stolen, both your operator and nominator stakes could be at risk of being slashed.
:::

The keys were generated in the subfolder of **NODE_DATA_PATH** under `/domains/domainID/keystore`. If you don't see the generated keypair in the subfolder, something went wrong. 

### Start the domain operator node

The domain operator node is running with an embedded consensus node, thus you need to specify the args for both the consensus node and the domain operator node:

```bash
subspace-node [consensus-chain-args] -- [domain-args]
```

Example:
Start a node as operator on `gemini-3h` chain:

:::info
You need to **wipe** and sync your node from genesis block without using snap sync, since you need to sync both consensus and domain chains.
You do not need to wipe any existing plots. 
:::

:::note
Ensure you replace `your_domain_id` with your domain identifier in the command and `your_operator_id` with your operator_id.
:::

:::tip
You can ignore setting up `your_operator_id` while you're syncing your node as you won't have an operator id until you have registered your operator. Make sure to set it after syncing and registration.

### Register an operator on domain

:::info
It's crucial to fully sync your node before registering as an operator. Please follow the commands in the ***Start the domain operator*** node section and only register as an operator once your node is fully synced. If many operators are registered but their nodes are still syncing or offline, it can adversely affect the speed of block production in the domain.
:::


#### Register an operator using Autonomys Staking interface (recommended)
1. Proceed to the [Autonomys Staking portal](https://explorer.subspace.network/gemini-3h/staking) and connect your wallet.

![NStaking-1](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-1.png)

2. Select the wallet you would like to connect. Both **Subwallet** and **PolkadotJS** wallets are supported.

![NStaking-2](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-2.png)

3. Enter your password to give an access to your wallet.

![NStaking-3](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-3.png)

4. Select the account you'd like to use form the dropdown menu. You can click the button in the upper left corner to see available and locked (staked) token balances for the selected account. 

![NStaking-4](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-4.png)

![NStaking-5](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-5.png)

5. Proceed to the `Register Operator` tab.

![NStaking-6](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-6.png)

6. Select the `domainId` you would like to be registered on.  For Stake Wars, Nova is Domain 0 and Auto-ID should be Domain 1 once it is available.

![NStaking-7](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-7.png)

7. An important security change from Stake Wars one is that you are now required to have a Proof of signing key ownership signature.  This is derived from your seed phrase when creating the operator key.  
You can either select the file that contains your seed in the subfolder of **NODE_DATA_PATH** under `/domains/domainID/keystore` and then click the choose file and point to that file or you can choose the Proof with seed and manually enter the seed phrase.
Once you click the Generate proof button it will automatically populate the `Signing key` and `Proof of signing key ownership signature` fields.  Enter the `Amount to Stake`, `Nominator Tax`, `Minimum Nominator Stake` and then click `Next`.

![NStaking-8](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-8.png)

:::info
Make sure to either locate the signing key file generated on the previous **[Create operator key](#create-operator-key)** step or use the key phrase that was displayed when the key was created and is also in that key file.
:::

8. Approve the request in the pop-up window. 

![NStaking-9](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-9.png)

8. Congratulations, you're now registered as an **operator**!  You can click on the Manage My Operator tab to see your operator and get the Operator Id.

![NStaking-10](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-10.png)

:::info
It can take up to 10 minutes for the operator to be registered and appear on the page.  It may take a day before your Stake amount is displayed under Total Stake in the grid.  Once you have your Operator Id you can restart your operator node and include the `--operator-id **OPERATOR_ID**` as a parameter. 
:::

:::tip
You can view some additional actions by clicking on `action` next to your operator. 
You can increase your stake (Nominate), withdraw some stake and de-register your operator from there.
