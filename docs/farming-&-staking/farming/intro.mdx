:::tip Installation Videos

For those who prefer a visual guide, we have prepared installation videos to assist you. The videos will help you to set up the Space Acres farming application in under 10 minutes. Please follow [the installation videos](/farming/space-acres/install#installation-videos) to use SubWallet to create a compatible Substrate account and refer to the detailed guide on downloading and configuring Autonomys' farming application, Space Acres.

## Operating System

## Hardware

| Hardware | CPU | RAM | Node Storage | Farm Storage |
| --- | --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Minimum [¬π](https://docs.autonomys.xyz/farming/intro#min-hardware) | 4 Cores+ | 8GB | 100GB [¬≤](https://docs.autonomys.xyz/farming/intro#min-node-storage) | 100GB |
| Recommended | Intel Core i7-6700 or equivalent | 16GB+ | 256GB | ‚ôæÔ∏è [¬≥](https://docs.autonomys.xyz/farming/intro#farm-storage) |

<small>¬π Nodes that meet minimum requirements should be able to farm and sync with the network under normal conditions. However, performance may decline during periods of heavy network load, such as when blocks are filled with numerous transactions.</small>
<br />
<p>
<small>¬≤ While 100GB is sufficient for running a farming node, a domain node will require more than 100GB of storage.</small>
<br />
<small>¬≥ Storage contribution impacts block and vote rewards on the Autonomys Network. More plotted sectors will lead to faster and more frequent rewards. You can start with as little as 100 GB, but allocating more will maximize your reward potential.</small>

:::warning Internet Considerations

Operating a node and farmer can be data intensive. It is advisable to have a stable and unlimited internet connection.

:::

### Reference Hardware

Our benchmarking tests were performed using the Intel Core i7-6700 CPU. We calibrated the transaction weights to ensure that a full block does not contain more transactions than this CPU can handle within the 2-second block execution time limit. This guarantees that nodes with hardware equivalent to or better than the Intel Core i7-6700 can process blocks at full capacity without performance issues.

While farmers using hardware below this specification may function effectively under most conditions, they could face challenges during peak network activity. If blocks consistently fill with transactions, nodes with lower specifications might struggle to keep pace, which could impact farming performance and rewards.

You can see detailed machine information used for the [reference hardware](https://gist.github.com/DaMandal0rian/21a01da49ee820c3e59bce7f8c2d0166).

## Storage

:::caution Hard Drives Not Supported

Hard disk drives are not supported. The use of smart caching, tiered storage, raid, or other acceleration methods will not be effective due to the significant random read IOPS required for the proving process.

:::

SSD storage is required. High end models are not necessary and a mid range SSD from a reputable manufacturer with adequate endurance should be sufficient. Be cautious with lesser known brands as they may face issues with maintaining consistent read performance. You can also use NVMe SSDs but this is not required.



## File Systems (Linux)

:::caution File Descriptor Limit

Linux systems may have a default file descriptor limit, which can vary based on distribuition. Exceeding this limit could cause errors. For detailed information, visit our [Tips & Tricks](/farming/advanced-cli/tips#changing-number-of-open-files-limit-linux) guide.

:::

<Tabs queryString="file-system">

<TabItem value="ext4" label="‚òëÔ∏è ext4" default>
This file system maximizes usable space for the farmer.
```bash title="Recommended Formatting Command for Drives Dedicated to Subspace Plots:"
sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -T largefile4 /dev/sdX
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="xfs" label="‚ùå XFS">
Resizing a plot when the drive is nearly full (98% or more) will render the plot unfarmable unless sufficient additional space is freed up through other means. Full disk utilization can only be achieved during the plot's initial creation and will yield less usable space compared to ext4.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cow" label="‚ùå CoW">
Copy-on-Write file systems (ReFS, BTRFS, ZFS, bcachefs, HAMMER) are not recommended due to increased latency and reduced write speeds associated with managing unnecessary data copies.
```bash title="Disable CoW on BTRFS:"
sudo chattr +C /path/to/farm
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="raid" label="‚ùå RAID">
The farmer employs checksums for data integrity and can recover from corrupted blocks. Striping provides no benefits and raises the risk of needing to replot multiple drives instead of just one.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="swap" label="‚ùå SWAP">
Only necessary if your system has limited RAM.
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Security Considerations

:::info Safety and Security Guide

For detailed information, visit our [Safety and Security](/learn/security) guide.

:::

Ensure your system is regularly updated, configure [port forwarding](/farming/guides/port-config#ports-to-forward--firewall-access), set up your [firewall](/farming/guides/port-config#firewall-configuration), and follow best practices for network safety. For comprehensive security guidelines, please refer to our [Safety and Security](/learn/security) guide.

## Wallet

:::info Wallets Guide

For detailed information, visit our [SubWallet](/wallets/subwallet) or [Polkadot.JS](/wallets/polkadot) guide.


:::

Before you begin, make sure you have a wallet to receive rewards. We recommend using [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app), but [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/extension) is also available. Install one of these wallets as a browser extension and create a new account. Your account address will be required during the setup process.

## Networking

:::info Port Forwarding & Firewall Guide

For detailed information on network configurations, including port forwarding requirements and firewall settings, please refer to our [Port Forwarding & Firewall](/farming/guides/port-config) guide.

:::

## Dependencies

:::caution No Output and Missing Error Codes

If you encounter a situation in Windows where the node produces no output and does not display any error code, it is likely that you simply need to install the latest version of the [Visual C++ Redistributable package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).
