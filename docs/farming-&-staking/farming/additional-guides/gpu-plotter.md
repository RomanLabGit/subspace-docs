## Overview

Autonomys utilizes your drive storage, specifically SSD or NVMe drives, to store plots. After the plotting process is finished, these plots are then farmed using your CPU. Farming is not particularly demanding on the CPU, enabling most modern processors to manage a substantial farm size. However, the plot creation process is highly resource intensive, which makes CPU plotting the main bottleneck.

Utilizing GPU plotting allows you to harness the power of compatible GPUs for plot generation and replotting, either in conjunction with or as a substitute for CPU processing. While many modern CPUs can complete the plotting of a sector in less than two minutes, a single high performance GPU can accomplish the same task in under five seconds, greatly improving efficiency and speed.

Although GPU plotting is not mandatory, it provides enhanced energy efficiency and speed compared to relying solely on a CPU.


:::note Plot Format Compatibility
GPU plotting employs the new **v1 plot format**, which is applicable to any plots created with versions released on or after **July 5th**. In contrast, older software versions generated plots in the **v0 format**, which is only compatible with CPU plotting.

### Intel

Intel Arc GPUs are expected to be supported in the future, but specific models have not been released yet.


## Common Plotting Parameters

Below are some essential parameters for configuring the GPU plotter:

- Set the number of sectors that the CPU plotter will encode simultaneously (the default setting is to use all supported GPUs when a compatible GPU is detected):
  ```bash
  --cpu-sector-encoding-concurrency <sectors>

  # Example:
  --cpu-sector-encoding-concurrency 2
  ```
- Specify particular GPUs for plotting rather than using all available GPUs (the default configuration employs all compatible GPUs):
  ```bash
  --cuda-gpus <gpu_ids>

  # Example:
  --cuda-gpus 0,1,3
  ```


## Farming Cluster
  
When utilizing Farming Cluster, particularly with multiple or fast GPUs, you might encounter limitations due to your network's bandwidth. High performance GPUs can easily surpass the capacity of a 1G connection. While this won't cause the process to fail, it may result in your GPU idling as it waits for data to transfer. To optimize performance in such scenarios, consider upgrading to networking solutions of 2.5G, 10G, or higher.


### Known Issues

- Plotting may occasionally halt unexpectedly, which necessitates a restart of the farmer.
