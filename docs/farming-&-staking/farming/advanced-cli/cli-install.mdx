:::tip Multiple Versions Available
We offer several versions of our releases to accommodate different CPU architectures:
- **Skylake:** Optimized for Intel Skylake and newer CPUs, as well as AMD Ryzen processors. Ideal for PCs manufactured from 2015 onward.
- **Legacy (x86-64-v2):** Designed for Intel Broadwell, Haswell, and older CPUs, along with their AMD counterparts. Suitable for systems built between 2009 and 2015 and for virtual environments that do not support Skylake instructions.
For the latest binaries and source code, please visit the **Releases** section on our [GitHub](https://github.com/autonomys/subspace/releases).

## Get Started with Advanced CLI Installation

:::note
Please note that a wallet with a Substrate address is required to run the software.<br />
To learn how to create a Substrate wallet, please visit our pages on [SubWallet (recommended)](docs/farming-&-staking/wallets/subwallet.md) or [Polkadot.js](docs/farming-&-staking/wallets/polkadot.md).

We will download two files for your respective operating system.
1. `Subspace-Node` - This is the executable that actually makes the connection with the Autonomys Network
2. `Subspace-Farmer` - This is the executable that will actually farm for rewards on your allocated storage plots.
